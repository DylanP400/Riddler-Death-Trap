# Riddler Death Trap ? 
## Can you escape the Riddler?

**Riddler Death Trap** is a batman quiz I made for my Portfoilio two project using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game starts with a introduction text with a play button once you click the play button the game will start. I have added 40 different questions to make the game more fun and for replayability. Each question has 4 answers.
